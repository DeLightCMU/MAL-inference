# MAL-inference
This repo is optimized for [Multiple Anchor Learning(MAL)](https://github.com/DeLightCMU/MAL) detector inference based on [NVIDIA Object Detection Toolkit (ODTK)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/retinanet-examples/).

For more details of MAL, please refer to our CVPR2020 paper: [Multiple Anchor Learning for Visual Object Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Ke_Multiple_Anchor_Learning_for_Visual_Object_Detection_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf)  and the [original MAL repo](https://github.com/DeLightCMU/MAL).

## 1. Installation

### Requirements:
- Python>=3

### Step-by-step installation
```bash
# first, make sure that your conda is setup properly with the right environment
# for that, check that `which conda`, `which pip` and `which python` points to the
# right path. From a clean conda env, this is what you need to do

conda activate

```

## 2. Running for COCO metrics (Pytorch)


## 3. Running for single images (C++)
